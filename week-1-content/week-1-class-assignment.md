# Week 1 Assignment

Folder name: `week-1-assignment`

#### Process

* Read through week 1 notes.
* Pick a haiku from [this website](http://jti.lib.virginia.edu/japanese/shiki/beichman/BeiShik.utf8.html)
* Pick a pair of adjectives from the following list and use them as inspiration for two web versions of your haiku (eg one with style that feels 'warm' and one with style that feels 'cool'). Try to use all the styles properties we over in the notes. Take some time to play with different visual styles here, don't just rush through.
  * warm / cool
  * day / night
  * calm / agitated
* Choose one line of your haiku to make interactive. Give it a hover style using the `:hover` pseudo-class, an active style using the `:active` pseudo-class, and change its style on click using jQuery's `click` and `toggleClass`.

#### End product

Two html files named, for example, `index-warm.html` and `index-cool.html`, depending on the adjectives you've chosen.
