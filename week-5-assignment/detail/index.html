			On a cold and blustery day on October 28, 1961, shovels broke ground in Queens for the first stadium to be built in New York City since 1923. The steel and concrete structure that grew in Flushing was originally going to be named "Flushing Meadows Stadium" but in the fall of 1962, civic leader Bernard Gimbel spearheaded a campaign to rename the facility Shea Stadium in honor of the man (popular attorney William A. Shea) who was the driving force in bringing a National League team back to the Big Apple. 

			<br>
			<br>

			The architectural firm of Praeger-Kavanagh-Waterbury designed the stadium to be the second all-purpose facility in the country capable of hosting baseball and football games, seating 55,300 for baseball and over 60,000 for New York Jets games. D.C. Stadium in Washington, opened in 1962, was the first all-purpose facility built just a year earlier. In June of 1962, steel grids began crawling skyward. Six months later the shell of Shea was completed and by July of 1963 pre-cast concrete units covered the steel framework.

			<br>

			Two bitterly cold winters in 1962 and 1963 and more than 17 different labor strikes forced Shea to open a year later than planned. The 45-acre plot where the young Mets could finally feel at home was the same land the city offered to Dodgers President Walter O'Malley in the mid 1950's before he bolted for the comforts of Los Angeles. (Folklore stories have long rumored that when city officials scouted out stadium sites, they went during the winter, when flight paths into LaGuardia are different, so they never anticipated the amount of aircraft noise during the summer).

			<br>

			On April 16, 1964, the day before Shea Stadium officially opened, Bill Shea christened the Mets' new home with two symbolic bottles of water: one from the Gowanus Canal, near Ebbets Field, the former home of the Brooklyn Dodgers and one from the Harlem River, near the Polo Grounds, where the New York Giants had played and later the Mets during their first two years. The next morning, April 17th, construction workers were painting outfield signs and fresh sod was being laid in the outfield as the teams took batting practice. The Mets lost, 4-3, to Pittsburgh that afternoon. The New York Times trumpeted the new stadium with the headline "50,312 attend opener at Shea Stadium; Lack of parking causes backups."

			The structure which the Amazin's called home contained 21 escalators, 54 public rest rooms, four public restaurants and an oversized scoreboard. The scoreboard - one of the largest in the majors - was 86 feet high, 175 feet wide, and weighed over 60 tons. The majestic giant board provided fans with out of town scores, scoring information, showed color slides and led the crowd in sing-alongs. The final bill for Shea was $24.5 million with the Mets chipping in an additional $6.5 million for their own office space, clubhouses, scoreboard, restaurants and press room.

			The stands moved to convert the field from baseball to football by two motor-operated sections that moved on underground railroad tracks. For baseball seating, the seats are behind first and home and third base and home; for football seating, the leftfield stands move clockwise to the centerfield and the rightfield stands move counterclockwise to centerfield that created seats parallel to the sidelines.

			Shea also was the first stadium to feature a "light ring." The illumination comes from banks of lights built into the top of the facility instead of stadiums whose lighting comes only from light towers. While there has never been a domed baseball or football stadium in the metro area, Shea was originally designed to be covered and to expand to seat 80,000 fans. However, due to cost overruns that idea never became a reality. Forty years later, as Shea embarks on a year-long anniversary celebration, the ballpark has become the fifth oldest in the majors.
